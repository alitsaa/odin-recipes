    <h2>Steps (VIA ALLRECIPES) </h2>
    <ol>
        <!-- Step 1  -->
        <li> Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line two 12-cup muffin tins with paper liners. </li>
        <!-- Step 2 -->
        <li> Mix cake mix water, oil, and egg whites in a large bowl with an electric mixer on low speed until moistened, 
            then mix on medium speed for 2 minutes. 
            Pour batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling each 1/2 full.</li>
        <!-- Step 3 -->
            <li> Bake in the preheated oven until tops spring back when lightly pressed, 
            19 to 23 minutes. Cool in the tins for 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack 
            and let cool completely, about 20 minutes more. </li>
        <!-- Step 4 -->
            <li> While the cupcakes are cooling, stir 2/3 of the frosting with green food coloring in a small bowl until well combined. 
            Place remaining frosting in another small bowl and set aside. 
            Cut each marshmallow in fourths widthwise to make four thin circles. 
            Place green sugar in a shallow bowl. Set out a very small bowl of water. </li>
        <!-- Step 5 -->
        <li>Frost cooled cupcakes with green frosting and sprinkle with some green sugar. </li>
        <!-- Step 6 -->
        <li> Wet half of each marshmallow circle with water, then dip the wet part into green sugar to coat. 
            Place two dipped marshmallows onto each cupcake for the frog's eyes; the green sugar should be facing up for the eyelids. 
            Use a tiny bit of white frosting to glue a chocolate chip onto the center of each marshmallow for the pupils. </li>
        <!-- Step 7 -->
         <li> Stir red food coloring into remaining white icing. 
            Transfer to a plastic bag. Snip off one corner of the bag and pipe pink 
            icing onto cupcakes to draw mouths and nostrils as desired.</li>
