    <h2>Steps (VIA ALLRECIPES)</h2>
    <ol>
        <!-- Step 1 -->
        <li>
            Prepare the steaks: Mix ground beef, bread crumbs, egg, ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, 
            mustard, soy sauce, pepper, and cayenne together in a mixing bowl with a fork or your hands 
            until well combined. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours or overnight.
        </li>
        <!-- Step 2 -->
        <li>
            When almost ready to cook the steaks, make the gravy: 
            Melt butter in a large nonstick skillet over high heat. 
            Add mushrooms, onion, and salt; sauté until nicely browned, 5 to 8 minutes. 
            Reduce the heat to medium and add flour; cook and stir for 3 minutes.
        </li>
        <!-- Step 3 -->
        <li>
            Stir in broth, ketchup, and Worcestershire sauce. 
            Increase the heat to high and bring to a simmer. 
            Reduce the heat to medium and cook, stirring occasionally, 
            until gravy thickens slightly and reduces, about 10 minutes. 
            Taste and adjust salt as needed.
        </li>
        <!-- Step 4 -->
        <li>Transfer gravy to a liquid measure. Scrape the pan clean with a spatula.</li>
        <!-- Step 5 -->
         <li>
            Finish the steaks: Remove meat from the refrigerator and divide into four equal portions. 
            Moisten hands and form each portion into a 1/2-inch-thick oval patty. 
            Lightly season both sides of patties with salt.
         </li>
         <!-- Step 6 -->
        <li>
            Melt butter in the clean skillet over medium-high heat. 
            Add patties and cook until browned, 2 to 3 minutes per side. 
            Pour in gravy and bring to a simmer. 
            Reduce the heat to medium and continue to cook until gravy is 
            piping hot and steaks are no longer pink in the center, about 5 more minutes. 
            An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 
            160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
